    "# Problem Statement: Impact of Lifestyle on Sleep Health\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Sleep plays a vital role in maintaining overall health and well-being. However, various lifestyle factors can significantly impact sleep quality and duration. Understanding the relationship between lifestyle choices and sleep health is essential for individuals seeking to improve their sleep patterns. As a data scientist, analyzing these factors can provide valuable insights into the causes and effects of sleep disturbances, helping individuals make informed decisions to optimize their sleep health.\n",
    "\n",
